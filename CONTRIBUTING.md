# Contributing to Shitty NCF

This project is intentionally minimal and educational. Contributions that make it **less shitty** are welcome, but remember: the goal is to show limitations, not build a production system.

## What We're Looking For

- **Bug fixes** (typos, actual errors)
- **Documentation improvements** (clarity, examples)
- **Educational enhancements** (better explanations of why things are shitty)
- **UI/UX improvements** (make it easier to understand the limitations)

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Making it production-ready (defeats the purpose)
- Adding complex features (keep it simple)
- Performance optimizations (it's supposed to be slow)
- GPU support (CPU-only is a feature, not a bug)

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Keep it simple and educational
4. Submit a PR with a clear description

## Code Style

- **Python**: PEP 8, but we're not strict
- **TypeScript/React**: Standard Next.js conventions
- **Comments**: Explain *why* it's shitty, not just what it does

## Questions?

Open an issue. This is a learning project, so questions and discussions are welcome.
